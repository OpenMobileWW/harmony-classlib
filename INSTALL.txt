Building Classlib for Windows7/Visual Studio 10
I built classpath using a Virtual Box (4.1.10) virt, with Guest Additions
  and Windows8, and also on a Samsung laptop with Windows 7
  Unfortunately, it does not appear to build with MSVS11, which is
  where the Metro API SDK is.  This configuration is using dlls from
  the MSVS11 install.  You'll have to fix them to point to the MSVS10
  versions, and fix the corresponding md5 sums if you don't want to
  install MSVS11.

- Install Windows 7 or 8
  Theres a trial version available here:
  http://windows.microsoft.com/
  en-US/windows-8/iso

  The license key for the trial verison is:
  DNJXJ-7XBW8-2378T-X22TX-BKG7J

- Install MVS 10
  Trial version available here:
  http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/try

  I booted Windows and installed it from there, instead of trying to download
  the iso.
